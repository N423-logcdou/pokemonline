        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>This is a Pokémon fan project centered around collecting Pokémon and managing items. The main feature of the site is the game where the Pokémon catching takes place, but there are a few other features on this site too. Once you are logged in, you are able to view the list of Pokémon you have seen and get some information about them on the Pokédex page. You are also able to manage the Pokémon in your storage and view other trainers' profiles.</p>
        <p>The project utilizes p5.js for the game aspects and Firebase to manage user authentication and data storage. The rest of the site consists of basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and Bootstrap 5 for some extra functionalities.</p>
        <p>Most sprites were sourced from Pokémon Crystal, but some were made by Nuuk. You can find their art <a href="https://twitter.com/nuukiie">here</a>.</p>

        <p>Check out 2 different maps with <span id="poke-count">24</span> different pokemon you can catch!</p>
        <p>Be strategic with unique combinations of berries and pokeballs to affect catch rate. (Currently only the pink berries increase catching odds. I hope to implement the other berries in a future version.)</p>
